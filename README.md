# Password Manager
I built this simply to see if I could do it and to strengthen my cryptography skills and knowledge. This Password Manager doesn't keep your master password. Instead, valid passwords are determined if it decrypts a known string correctly. Additionally, the salt and verifier hashes would be kept in a secure database. However, for educational purposes, I've kept them in text files. 

I'd love to hear from you about where I could improve it!

## Instructions
Run the god_key_hasher.py file and enter your desired master password. You can access your new vault by running the pm_db.py file and entering your master password.

## Demo
You can run the demo by opening the pm_db.py file and using **thisisatest!** as the password.

## Disclaimer
This was built for educational purposes. This should not be used as your password manager. This software is provided as is and I do not take any responsibility for any damage or loss done with or by it.
